# Objects has behabiour and state. There are 4 pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism

# Encapsulation: Wrapping up of data and methods into a single unit called class. It is a way to restrict access to some parts of an object.

# Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user.

# Inheritance: A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviour from another class.

# Polymorphism: The ability to present the same interface for different data types.
